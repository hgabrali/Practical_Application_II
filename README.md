# Practical_Application_II

Overview:
In this application, you will explore a dataset from kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

To frame the task, throughout these practical applications we will refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM. This process provides a framework for working through a data problem. Your first step in this application will be to read through a brief overview of CRISP-DM Links to an external site..

Data:
You will work with a used cars dataset Links to an external site.for this assignment.

Deliverables:
